<h3 id="general-questions">General Questions:</h3>

<h4 id="what-function-does-dns-play-on-a-network">What function does DNS play on a network?</h4>

<p>How does DNS work?
1 The first place your computer looks is its local DNS cache, which stores information that your computer has recently retrieved.
2 If the information is not stored locally, your computer queries (contacts) your ISP’s recursive DNS servers. These specialized computers perform the legwork of a DNS query on your behalf. Recursive servers have their own caches, so the process usually ends here and the information is returned to the user.
3 If the recursive servers don’t have the answer, they query the root nameservers. A nameserver is a computer that answers questions about domain names, such as IP addresses. The thirteen root nameservers act as a kind of telephone switchboard for DNS.
4 The root nameservers will look at the first part of our request, reading from right to left — www.dyn.com — and direct our query to the Top-Level Domain (TLD) nameservers for .com. Each TLD, such as .com, .org, and .us, have their own set of nameservers, which act like a receptionist for each TLD.
5 The TLD nameservers review the next part of our request — www.dyn.com — and direct our query to the nameservers responsible for this specific domain. These authoritative nameservers are responsible for knowing all the information about a specific domain, which are stored in DNS records. There are many types of records, which each contain a different kind of information. In this example, we want to know the IP address for www.dyndns.com, so we ask the authoritative nameserver for the Address Record (A).
6 The recursive server retrieves the A record for dyn.com from the authoritative nameservers and stores the record in its local cache. If anyone else requests the host record for dyn.com, the recursive servers will already have the answer and will not need to go through the lookup process again. All records have a time-to-live value, which is like an expiration date. After a while, the recursive server will need to ask for a new copy of the record to make sure the information doesn’t become out-of-date.
7 Armed with the answer, recursive server returns the A record back to your computer. Your computer stores the record in its cache, reads the IP address from the record, then passes this information to your browser. The browser then opens a connection to the webserver and receives the website.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-http">What is HTTP?</h4>

<p>The HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) protocol works in a client and server model like most other protocols. A web browser using which a request is initiated is called as a client and a web server software which responds to that request is called a server. World Wide Web Consortium and the Internet Engineering Task Force are two important spokes in the standardization of the HTTP protocol. HTTP allows improvement of its request and response with the help of intermediates, for example a gateway, a proxy, or a tunnel. The resources that can be requested using the HTTP protocol, are made available using a certain type of URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) called a URL (Uniform Resource Locator). TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is used to establish a connection to the application layer port 80 used by HTTP.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-an-http-proxy-and-how-does-it-work">What is an HTTP proxy and how does it work?</h4>

<p>A HTTP proxy speaks the HTTP protocol, it&rsquo;s especially made for HTTP connections but can be abused for other protocols as well (which is kinda standard already)
The browser (CLIENT) sends something like &ldquo;GET <a href="http://host.tld/path">http://host.tld/path</a> HTTP/1.1&rdquo; to the PROXY
and the PROXY will then forward the request to the SERVER. The SERVER will only see the PROXY as connection and answer to the PROXY just like to a CLIENT.
The PROXY receives the response and forwards it back to the CLIENT.
It is a transparent process and nearly like directly communicating with a server.
There are some additional heads that can be sent, proxies sometimes change/add stuff.
Some proxies for example include your real IP in a special HTTP HEADER which can be logged on server-side, or intercepted in their scripts.
CLIENT &lt;&mdash;&gt; PROXY &lt;&mdash;&gt; SERVER</p>

<h4 id="describe-briefly-how-https-works">Describe briefly how HTTPS works.</h4>

<p>HTTPS takes the well-known and understood HTTP protocol, and simply layers a SSL/TLS encryption layer on top of it. Servers and clients still speak exactly the same HTTP to each other, but over a secure SSL connection that encrypts and decrypts their requests and responses.
How an SSL connection is established?
An SSL connection between a client and server is set up by a handshake, once the connection is established, both parties can use the agreed algorithm and keys to securely send messages to each other. We will break the handshake up into 3 main phases - Hello, Certificate Exchange and Key Exchange.
<em>Hello</em> - The handshake begins with the client sending a ClientHello message. This contains all the information the server needs in order to connect to the client via SSL, including the various cipher suites and maximum SSL version that it supports. The server responds with a ServerHello, which contains similar information required by the client, including a decision based on the client’s preferences about which cipher suite and version of SSL will be used.
<em>Certificate Exchange</em> - Now that contact has been established, the server has to prove its identity to the client. This is achieved using its SSL certificate, which is a very tiny bit like its passport. An SSL certificate contains various pieces of data, including the name of the owner, the property (eg. domain) it is attached to, the certificate’s public key, the digital signature and information about the certificate’s validity dates. The client checks that it either implicitly trusts the certificate, or that it is verified and trusted by one of several Certificate Authorities (CAs) that it also implicitly trusts.
<em>Key Exchange</em> - The encryption of the actual message data exchanged by the client and server will be done using a symmetric algorithm, the exact nature of which was already agreed during the Hello phase. A symmetric algorithm uses a single key for both encryption and decryption, in contrast to asymmetric algorithms that require a public/private key pair. Both parties need to agree on this single, symmetric key, a process that is accomplished securely using asymmetric encryption and the server’s public/private keys.
The client generates a random key to be used for the main, symmetric algorithm. It encrypts it using an algorithm also agreed upon during the Hello phase, and the server’s public key (found on its SSL certificate). It sends this encrypted key to the server, where it is decrypted using the server’s private key, and the interesting parts of the handshake are complete.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-smtp-give-the-basic-scenario-of-how-a-mail-message-is-delivered-via-smtp">What is SMTP? Give the basic scenario of how a mail message is delivered via SMTP.</h4>

<p>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is based on end-to-end message delivery. An Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) client contacts the destination host&rsquo;s Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server on well-known port 25, to deliver the mail. The client then waits for the server to send a 220 READY FOR MAIL message. Upon receipt of the 220 message, the client sends a HELO command. The server then responds with a &ldquo;250 Requested mail action okay&rdquo; message.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-raid-what-is-raid0-raid1-raid5-raid10">What is RAID? What is RAID0, RAID1, RAID5, RAID10?</h4>

<p>RAID 0 - Minimum 2 disks, No redundancy (no mirror, no parity), Excellent performance
RAID 1 - Minimum 2 disks, Excellent redundancy (as blocks are mirrored), Good performance (no striping, no parity)
RAID 5 - Minimum 3 disks, Good redundancy (distributed parity), Good performance (as blocks are striped)
RAID LEVEL 10 - Minimum 4 disks, Excellent redundancy (as blocks are mirrored), Excellent performance (as blocks are striped)</p>

<h4 id="what-is-a-level-0-backup-what-is-an-incremental-backup">What is a level 0 backup? What is an incremental backup?</h4>

<p>A full backup is level 0. A level n backup will back up everything that has changed since the most recent level n-1 backup. Suppose for instance that a level 0 backup was taken on a Sunday. A level 1 backup taken on Monday would include only changes made since Sunday. A level 2 backup taken on Tuesday would include only changes made since Monday. A level 3 backup taken on Wednesday would include only changes made since Tuesday. If a level 2 backup was taken on Thursday, it would include all changes made since Monday because Monday was the most recent level n-1 backup.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-the-unix-linux-command-to-remove-a-directory-and-its-contents">What is the Unix/Linux command to remove a directory and its contents?</h4>

<p>rm -rf directoryname</p>

<h4 id="which-command-will-show-you-free-used-memory-does-free-memory-exist-on-linux">Which command will show you free/used memory? Does free memory exist on Linux?</h4>

<p>free -m, cat /proc/meminfo, vmstat, top, htop
Linux is borrowing unused memory for disk caching. This makes it looks like you are low on memory, but you are not!
This is just a difference in terminology. Both you and Linux agree that memory taken by applications is &ldquo;used&rdquo;, while memory that isn&rsquo;t used for anything is &ldquo;free&rdquo;.
But how do you count memory that is currently used for something, but can still be made available to applications?
You might count that memory as &ldquo;free&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;available&rdquo;. Linux instead counts it as &ldquo;used&rdquo;, but also &ldquo;available&rdquo;:
To see how much ram your applications could use without swapping, run free -m and look at the &ldquo;available&rdquo; column:</p>

<h4 id="how-to-search-for-the-string-my-konfi-is-the-best-in-files-of-a-directory-recursively">How to search for the string &ldquo;my konfi is the best&rdquo; in files of a directory recursively?</h4>

<p>You can use find and grep command.
find ./#### -type f -exec grep -H &lsquo;my konfi is the best&rsquo; {} \;
grep -r &lsquo;my konfi is the best&rsquo; ./*</p>

<h4 id="how-to-connect-to-a-remote-server-or-what-is-ssh">How to connect to a remote server or what is SSH?</h4>

<p>Secure Shell, or SSH, is a cryptographic (encrypted) network protocol to allow remote login and other network services to operate securely over an unsecured network. Port 22

<p>top
cat /proc/loadavg
1.00 1.01 0.98 <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>198</sub> 21533
uptime
18:37:28 up 4 days,  7:17,  4 users,  load average: 1.00, 1.01, 0.98
The three numbers after load average -  1.00, 1.01, 0.98 - represent the 1-, 5-, and 15-minute load averages on the machine. A system load average is equal to the average number of processes in a runnable or uninterruptible state. Runnable processes are either currently using the CPU or waiting to do so, and uninterruptible processes are waiting for I/O.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-a-linux-kernel-module">What is a Linux kernel module?</h4>

<p>Modules are pieces of code that can be loaded and unloaded into the kernel upon demand. They extend the functionality of the kernel without the need to reboot the system. For example, one type of module is the device driver, which allows the kernel to access hardware connected to the system.</p>

<h4 id="walk-me-through-the-steps-in-booting-into-single-user-mode-to-troubleshoot-a-problem">Walk me through the steps in booting into single user mode to troubleshoot a problem.</h4>

<ol>
<li>Wait until the BIOS has finished loading, or has almost finished.</li>
<li>Quickly press and hold the Shift key, which will bring up the GNU GRUB menu. (If you see the Ubuntu logo, you&rsquo;ve missed the point where you can enter the GRUB menu.)</li>
<li>Select the line which starts with &ldquo;Advanced options&rdquo; and Select the line ending with &ldquo;(recovery mode)&rdquo;</li>
<li>Press Return and your machine will begin the boot process.</li>
<li>After a few moments, your workstation should display a menu with a number of options. One of the options (you may need to scroll down to the bottom of the list) will be &ldquo;Drop to root shell prompt&rdquo;. Press Return with this option highlighted.</li>
<li>The root partition is mounted read-only. To mount it read/write, enter the command - mount -o remount,rw /</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="walk-me-through-the-steps-you-d-take-to-troubleshoot-a-404-error-on-a-web-application-you-administer">Walk me through the steps you&rsquo;d take to troubleshoot a 404 error on a web application you administer.</h4>

<p>The 404 status code, or a Not Found error, means that the user is able to communicate with the server but it is unable to locate the requested file or resource.
1. Does the link that directed the user to your server resource have a typographical error in it?
2. Did the user type in the wrong URL?
3. Does the file exist in the correct location on the server? Was the resource was moved or deleted on the server?
4. Does the server configuration have the correct document root location?
5. Does the user that owns the web server worker process have privileges to traverse to the directory that the requested file is in?
6. Is the resource being accessed a symbolic link? If so, ensure the web server is configured to follow symbolic links</p>
