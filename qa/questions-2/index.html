    <h1>Questions. Part 2</h1>
    

<h3 id="hard-linux-questions">Hard Linux Questions:</h3>

<p><details>
<summary><b>What is a tunnel and how you can bypass a http proxy?</b></summary><br></p>

<ul>
<li>A tunnel is a mechanism used to ship a foreign protocol across a network that normally wouldn&rsquo;t support it. Tunneling protocols allow you to use, for example, IP to send another protocol in the &ldquo;data&rdquo; portion of the IP datagram. Most tunneling protocols operate at layer 4 (Transport), which means they are implemented as a protocol that replaces something like TCP or UDP.</li>
<li>You can forward a port from your computer to a remote computer, which has the result of tunneling your data over SSH in the process, making it secure. This may not seem useful, after all, why would I want a port on my computer being forwarded to another computer? The answer lies within some clarification. The port forwarding function of SSH works by first listening on a local socket for a connection. When a connection is made, SSH will forward the entire connection onto the remote host and portable.
</details></li>
</ul>

<p><details>
<summary><b>What is the difference between IDS and IPS?</b></summary><br></p>

<ul>
<li>IDS - Intrusion Detection System - A device or application that analyzes whole packets, both header and payload, looking for known events. When a known event is detected a log message is generated detailing the event.</li>
<li>IPS - Intrusion Prevention System - A device or application that analyzes whole packets, both header and payload, looking for known events. When a known event is detected the packet is rejected.
</details></li>
</ul>

<p><details>
<summary><b>What shortcuts do you use on a regular basis?</b></summary><br></p>

<p>For example check dotfiles <a href="https://github.com/jivoi/dotfiles/blob/master/.aliases">https://github.com/jivoi/dotfiles/blob/master/.aliases</a>
</details></p>

<p><details>
<summary><b>What is the Linux Standard Base?</b></summary><br></p>

<p>LSB is a project to standardize the software system structure, including the filesystem hierarchy used in the Linux operating system. The LSB is based on the POSIX specification, the Single UNIX Specification (SUS), and several other open standards, but extends them in certain areas.
</details></p>

<p><details>
<summary><b>What is an atomic operation?</b></summary><br></p>

<p>For example we can say that atomic operation is a an operation during which a process can simultaneously read a location and write it in the same bus operation. This prevents any other process or I/O device from writing or reading memory until the operation is complete. Atomic implies indivisibility and irreducibility, so an atomic operation must be performed entirely or not performed at all.
</details></p>

<p><details>
<summary><b>Your freshly configured http server is not running after a restart, what can you do?</b></summary><br></p>

<p>If you rebooted server and http server is not running after it, so first you need to check it configuration file and the server error log where you can find the proble why server is not running, and after you can run it manually with <code>init\upstart\systemd</code> script, if you want that server run automatically you need enable autostart for it - <code>systemctl enable nginx</code> (for linux with systemd)
</details></p>

<p><details>
<summary><b>What kind of keys are in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys and what it is this file used for?</b></summary><br></p>

<p>This is a public ssh key. With public key authentication, the authenticating entity has a public key and a private key. Each key is a large number with special mathematical properties. The private key is kept on the computer you log in from, while the public key is stored on the .ssh/authorized_keys file on all the computers you want to log in to.
</details></p>

<p><details>
<summary><b>I&rsquo;ve added my public ssh key into authorized_keys but I&rsquo;m still getting a password prompt, what can be wrong?</b></summary><br></p>

<ul>
<li>Maybe your ~/.ssh/authorized_keys permissions are too open by OpenSSH standards. You need to check this and fix with:

<ul>
<li><code>chmod 700 ~/.ssh</code></li>
<li><code>chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Maybe remote server is configured to disable public keys, you can check it in /etc/sshd_config configuration file where PubkeyAuthentication option must be set to YES</li>
<li>Maybe it is something with you local ssh configuration ~/.ssh/config
</details></li>
</ul>

<p><details>
<summary><b>Did you ever create RPM&rsquo;s, DEB&rsquo;s or solaris pkg&rsquo;s?</b></summary><br></p>

<ul>
<li>Deb. <code>sudo apt-get install dh-make bzr-builddeb</code> ; <code>bzr add debian/source/format</code>
</details></li>
</ul>

<p><details>
<summary><b>What does <code>:(){ :|:&amp; };:</code> do on your system?</b></summary><br></p>

<p>This is a fork bomb using the Bash shell. In computing, a fork bomb (also called rabbit virus or wabbit) is a denial-of-service attack wherein a process continually replicates itself to deplete available system resources, causing resource starvation and slowing or crashing the system.
</details></p>

<p><details>
<summary><b>How do you catch a Linux signal on a script?</b></summary><br></p>

<p>There is a trap command that allows you to catch a linux signal and execute a command when a signal is received by your shell script. It works like this: <code>trap arg signals</code>
* Example: <code>trap &quot;rm $TEMP_FILE; exit&quot; SIGHUP SIGINT SIGTERM</code>
</details></p>

<p><details>
<summary><b>Can you catch a SIGKILL?</b></summary><br></p>

<p>SIGKILL or signal 9 is one signal that you cannot trap and catch. The linux kernel immediately terminates any process sent this signal and no signal handling is performed.
</details></p>

<p><details>
<summary><b>What&rsquo;s happening when the Linux kernel is starting the OOM killer and how does it choose which process to kill first?</b></summary><br></p>

<ul>
<li>The process to be killed in an out-of-memory situation is selected based on its badness score. The badness score is reflected in <code>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/oom_score</code>. This value is determined on the basis that the system loses the minimum amount of work done, recovers a large amount of memory, doesn&rsquo;t kill any innocent process eating tons of memory, and kills the minimum number of processes (if possible limited to one).</li>
<li>The badness score is computed using the original memory size of the process, its CPU time (utime + stime), the run time (uptime - start time) and its oom_adj value. The more memory the process uses, the higher the score. The longer a process is alive in the system, the smaller the score.
</details></li>
</ul>

<p><details>
<summary><b>Describe the linux boot process with as much detail as possible, starting from when the system is powered on and ending when you get a prompt.</b></summary><br></p>

<ol>
<li>BIOS (Basic Input Output System) - initializes hardware, then go step-by-step through each boot device based on the boot device order it is configured to follow until it finds one it can successfully boot from. POST(Power On Self Test)</li>
<li>MBR or GPT - (master boot record: the first 512 bytes on a hard drive) and loading and executing the boot code inside the MBR to start the boot process.</li>
<li>GRUB - boot from a hard drive. Once we select a particular kernel in GRUB, GRUB will load the Linux kernel into RAM and execute it.</li>
<li>Kernel. Usually GRUB will also load an initrd (initial RAM disk) along with the kernel.</li>
<li><code>initrd</code> (initial RAM disk) - has some crucial configuration files, kernel modules, and programs that the kernel needs in order to find and mount the real root file system.</li>
<li>Init and Runlevel programs. The final step is to execute the <code>/sbin/init</code> program, which takes over the rest of the boot process. The <code>/sbin/init</code> program is the parent process of every program running on the system. This process always has a PID of 1 and is responsible for starting the rest of the processes that make up a running Linux system. Looks at the <code>/etc/inittab</code> file to decide the Linux run level.

<ul>
<li>0 – halt</li>
<li>1 – Single user mode</li>
<li>2 – Multiuser, without NFS</li>
<li>3 – Full multiuser mode</li>
<li>4 – unused</li>
<li>5 – X11</li>
<li>6 – reboot
</details></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><details>
<summary><b>What&rsquo;s a chroot jail?</b></summary><br></p>

<p>A chroot jail is a way to isolate a process and its children from the rest of the system. It should only be used for processes that don&rsquo;t run as root, as root users can break out of the jail very easily.
The idea is that you create a directory tree where you copy or link in all the system files needed for a process to run. You then use the chroot() system call to change the root directory to be at the base of this new tree and start the process running in that chroot&rsquo;d environment. Since it can&rsquo;t actually reference paths outside the modified root, it can&rsquo;t perform operations (read/write etc.) maliciously on those locations.
</details></p>

<p><details>
<summary><b>When trying to unmount a directory it says it&rsquo;s busy, how to find out which PID holds the directory?</b></summary><br></p>

<p>Look at the <code>lsof</code> command (list open files) &ndash; it can tell you which processes are holding what open. <code>lsof | grep (your device name here)</code>
</details></p>

<p><details>
<summary><b>What&rsquo;s LD_PRELOAD and when it&rsquo;s used?</b></summary><br></p>

<p>If you set LD_PRELOAD to the path of a shared object, that file will be loaded before any other library (including the C runtime, libc.so).
</details></p>

<p><details>
<summary><b> You ran a binary and nothing happened. How would you debug this?</b></summary><br></p>

<p>Check rules, use strace
</details></p>

<p><details>
<summary><b>What are cgroups? Can you specify a scenario where you could use them?</b></summary><br></p>

<ul>
<li>cgroups (aka control groups) -Linux kernel feature that limits, accounts for, and isolates the resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network, etc.) of a collection of processes. Compared to other approaches like the <code>nice</code> command or <code>/etc/security/limits.conf</code>, cgroups are more flexible as they can operate on (sub)sets of processes (possibly with different system users). Example: <code>/sys/fs/cgroup</code></li>
<li>Cgroups provides:

<ul>
<li>Resource limiting – groups can be set to not exceed a configured memory limit, which also includes the file system cache</li>
<li>Prioritization – some groups may get a larger share of CPU utilization or disk I/O throughput</li>
<li>Accounting – measures a group&rsquo;s resource usage, which may be used, for example, for billing purposes</li>
<li>Control – freezing groups of processes, their checkpointing and restarting
</details></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><details>
<summary><b>How can you remove/delete a file with file-name consisting of only non-printable/non-type-able characters?</b></summary><br></p>

<p>A bit more risky approach is to use <code>rm -i -- *</code>. With the <code>-i</code> option <code>rm</code> requires confirmation before removing a file, so you can skip all files you want to keep but the one.
</details></p>

<p><details>
<summary><b>How can you increase or decrease the priority of a process in Linux?</b></summary><br></p>

<p>The Linux niceness scale goes from -20 to 19. The lower the number the more priority that task gets.
* <code>nice -n [nice value] [command]:</code>
* <code>renice 10 -p 21827</code>
</details></p>

<p><details>
<summary><b>What are run-levels in Linux?</b></summary><br></p>

<p>A system can be booted into (i.e., started up into) any of several runlevels (0-6), each of which is represented by a single digit integer. Each runlevel designates a different system configuration and allows access to a different combination of processes (i.e., instances of executing programs).
</details></p>

<h3 id="expert-linux-questions">Expert Linux Questions:</h3>

<p><details>
<summary><b>A running process gets EAGAIN: Resource temporarily unavailable on reading a socket. How can you close this bad socket/file descriptor without killing the process?</b></summary><br></p>

<ul>
<li><code>man errno | grep  EAGAIN</code>. EAGAIN basically just means that there was nothing to read at that time but the socket is non-blocking so the function must return. The connection is still good you should just try the read again
</details></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="networking-questions">Networking Questions:</h3>

<p><details>
<summary><b>What is localhost and why would ping localhost fail?</b></summary><br></p>

<ul>
<li>localhost - the standard hostname given to the address assigned to the loopback network interface. Translated into an IP address, a localhost is always designated as 127.0.0.1.
Ping can fail if loopback interface is down, also it is possible to configure local iptables(firewall) in such a way as to drop all packets received on localhost.
</details></li>
</ul>

<p><details>
<summary><b>What is the similarity between &ldquo;ping&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;traceroute&rdquo; ? How is traceroute able to find the hops.</b></summary><br></p>

<p>Both of this programs can be used to troubleshoot connection problems.
* Traceroute - shows you the path that packets take from your local system to a remote host. You see the response time to each step along the way, because each datagram has a TTL (time-to-live) that&rsquo;s one hop longer than the previous one.
</details></p>

<p><details>
<summary><b>What is the command used to show all open ports and/or socket connections on a machine?</b></summary><br></p>

<ul>
<li><code>lsof -i</code></li>
<li><code>netstat -natupx</code>
</details></li>
</ul>

<p><details>
<summary><b>Is 300.168.0.123 a valid IPv4 address?</b></summary><br></p>

<p>No, IPv4 addresses are canonically represented in dot-decimal notation, which consists of four decimal numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255, separated by dots, e.g., 172.16.254.1.
</details></p>

<p><details>
<summary><b>Which IP ranges/subnets are &ldquo;private&rdquo; or &ldquo;non-routable&rdquo; (RFC 1918)?</b></summary><br></p>

<p>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has reserved the following three blocks of the IP address space for private internets:
* 10.0.0.0        -   10.255.255.255  (<sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> prefix)
* 172.16.0.0      -   172.31.255.255  (172.<sup>16</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub> prefix)
* 192.168.0.0     -   192.168.255.255 (192.<sup>168</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> prefix)
     </details></p>

<p><details>
<summary><b>What is a VLAN?</b></summary><br></p>

<p>A virtual LAN (VLAN) is any broadcast domain that is partitioned and isolated in a computer network at the data link layer (OSI layer 2).
To subdivide a network into virtual LANs, one configures a network switch or router. Simpler network devices can only partition per physical port (if at all), in which case each VLAN is connected with a dedicated network cable (and VLAN connectivity is limited by the number of hardware ports available).
</details></p>

<p><details>
<summary><b>What is ARP and what is it used for?</b></summary><br></p>

<p>The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a protocol used for resolution of network layer addresses into link layer addresses. ARP is used for mapping a network address (e.g. an IPv4 address) to a physical address like an Ethernet address (also named a MAC address).
When we try to ping an IP address on our local network, say 192.168.1.2, our system has to turn the IP address 192.168.1.2 into a MAC address. This involves using ARP to resolve the address, hence its name.
</details></p>

<p><details>
<summary><b>What is the difference between TCP and UDP?</b></summary><br></p>

<ul>
<li>TCP is connection-oriented protocol. UDP is connectionless protocol</li>
<li>TCP provides delivery guarantee. UDP is unreliable, it doesn&rsquo;t provide any delivery guarantee.</li>
<li>TCP guarantees order of message. UDP doesn&rsquo;t provide any ordering or sequencing guarantee</li>
<li>TCP is slow. UDP is fast
</details></li>
</ul>

<p><details>
<summary><b>What is the purpose of a default gateway?</b></summary><br></p>

<p>A default gateway in computer networking is the node that is assumed to know how to forward packets on to other networks. The gateway is by definition a router.
</details></p>

<p><details>
<summary><b>What is command used to show the routing table on a Linux box?</b></summary><br></p>

<ul>
<li><code>route -n</code></li>
<li><code>netstat -rn</code></li>
<li><code>ip route list</code>
</details></li>
</ul>

<p><details>
<summary><b>A TCP connection on a network can be uniquely defined by 4 things. What are those things?</b></summary><br></p>

<p>remote-ip-address, remote-port, source-ip-address, source-port
</details></p>

<p><details>
<summary><b>When a client running a web browser connects to a web server, what is the source port and what is the destination port of the connection?</b></summary><br></p>

<ul>
<li>destination port - is 80 for HTTP or 443 for HTTPS</li>
<li>source port - will be random number from option net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range, by default it will be something like between 32768 and 61000
</details></li>
</ul>

<p><details>
<summary><b>How do you add an IPv6 address to a specific interface?</b></summary><br></p>

<ul>
<li>ip : <code>/sbin/ip -6 addr add 2001:0db8:0:f101::1/64 dev eth0</code></li>
<li>ifconfig: <code>/sbin/ifconfig eth0 inet6 add 2001:0db8:0:f101::1/64</code>
It is temporarily, you will lost this configuration after reboot. To add permanent ipv6 you need to add option to config file.
</details></li>
</ul>

<p><details>
<summary><b>You have added an IPv4 and IPv6 address to interface eth0. A ping to the v4 address is working but a ping to the v6 address gives yout the response <code>sendmsg: operation not permitted</code>. What could be wrong?</b></summary><br></p>

<p>This means that your server is not allowed to send ICMP packets. (Internet Control Message Protocol)
Check firewall rules: <code>ip6tables -P INPUT ACCEPT</code> ; <code>ip6tables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT</code> ; <code>ip6tables -P FORWARD ACCEPT</code>
</details></p>

<p><details>
<summary><b>What is SNAT and when should it be used?</b></summary><br></p>

<p>Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) - changes the source address in IP header of a packet. It may also change the source port in the TCP/UDP headers. The typical usage is to change the a private (rfc1918) address/port into a public address/port for packets leaving your network.
</details></p>

<p><details>
<summary><b>Explain how could you ssh login into a Linux system that DROPs all new incoming packets using a SSH tunnel.</b></summary><br></p>

<p>Reverse SSH Tunnel.
1. Execute on remote server: <code>ssh -fN -R 7000:localhost:22 username@yourMachine-ipaddress</code>
So this ssh connection request originating from remote server to your machine will make sure that any ssh connection request for port 7000 on your machine is forwarded to port 22 of remote server.
2. Now do an ssh connection request from your machine to your own machine at port 7000: <code>ssh username@localhost -p 7000</code>
</details></p>

<p><details>
<summary><b>How do you stop a DDoS attack?</b></summary><br></p>

<p>It is very complicated questions. Simple way is:
* Limiting the ammount of concurrent connections from ddos IP address to your Server with firewall rules.
* Optimize you server configuration options
</details></p>

<p><details>
<summary><b>How can you see content of an ip packet?</b></summary><br></p>

<ul>
<li><code>tcpdump -XX -i eth0</code></li>
<li><code>tshark -i eth0 -x</code>
</details></li>
</ul>

<p><details>
<summary><b>What is IPoAC (RFC 1149)?</b></summary><br></p>

<p>IP over Avian Carriers (IPoAC) is a humorously intended proposal to carry Internet Protocol (IP) traffic by birds such as homing pigeons

<p><details>
<summary><b>What is the difference between a &ldquo;left&rdquo; and a &ldquo;right&rdquo; join?</b></summary><br></p>

<p>Table from which you are taking data is &lsquo;LEFT&rsquo;. Table you are joining is &lsquo;RIGHT&rsquo;.
* LEFT JOIN - take all items from left table AND (only) matching items from right table.
* RIGHT JOIN - take all items from right table AND (only) matching items from left table.
</details></p>

<p><details>
<summary><b>Explain briefly the differences between InnoDB and MyISAM.</b></summary><br></p>

<p>MYISAM.You can use MyISAM, if the table is more static with lots of select and less update and delete.</p>

<ul>
<li>MYISAM supports Table-level Locking</li>
<li>MyISAM designed for need of speed</li>
<li>MYISAM not supports transaction. You cannot commit and rollback with MYISAM. Once you issue a c- ommand - it’s done.</li>

<summary><b>What is a dynamically/statically linked file?</b></summary><br></p>

<ul>
<li>Statically - means that the linker program (ld) after source code compilation adds all librarys and other dependencies directly to executable file</li>
<li>Dynamically - means that the above step doesn&rsquo;t happen. The operating system&rsquo;s loader needs to find the dependencies code, load it into memory, each time the program is run.
</details></li>
</ul>

<p><details>
<summary><b>What does <code>./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</code> do?</b></summary><br></p>

<p>This commands is need if you what to build software from source code.
* configure - is a script which is responsible for getting ready to build the software on your specific system. It makes sure all of the dependencies for the rest of the build and install process are available, and finds out whatever it needs to know to use those dependencies.
* make - is a command  which runs a series of tasks defined in a Makefile to build the finished program from its source code.
* make install - is a command which will copy the built program, and its libraries and documentation, to the correct locations.

<summary><b>What is the difference between Containers and VMs?</b></summary><br></p>

<p>With containers, these operating systems are isolated (they have their own file systems, processes, libraries including the libc, IP address, etc.) but they are nevertheless sharing the very same kernel. That&rsquo;s the reason why uname -a showed your host kernel version.
With traditional virtualization, the operating systems have each one their own kernel running. These multiple kernels are not running on top of the real hardware, but on top of a virtualized hardware provided by a piece of software called an hypervisor. This is an extra layer compared to container based virtualization.

<summary><b>What is a virtual IP address? What is a cluster?</b></summary><br></p>

<p>A virtual IP address (VIP or VIPA) - an IP address that doesn&rsquo;t correspond to an actual physical network interface (port). Uses for VIPs include Network Address Translation (especially, One-to-many NAT), fault-tolerance, and mobility.
Virtual IP addresses are commonly used to enable high availability. A standard failover design uses an active/passive server pair connected by replication and watched by a cluster manager. The active server listens on a virtual IP address; applications use it for connections instead of the normal host IP address. Should the active server fail, the cluster manager promotes the passive server and shifts the floating IP address to the newly promoted host. Application connections break and then reconnect to the VIP again, which points them to the new server. Cluster - a set of loosely or tightly connected computers that work together so that, in many respects, they can be viewed as a single system.

<summary><b>What is Automake and Autoconf?</b></summary><br></p>

<ul>
<li>Automake and Autoconf both are parts of The GNU build system, also known as the Autotools, is a suite of programming tools designed to assist in making source code packages portable to many Unix-like systems.</li>
<li>Automake - is a programming tool to automate parts of the compilation process. It eases usual compilation problems. For example, it points to needed dependencies. It automatically generates one or more Makefile.in from files called Makefile.am. Each Makefile.am contains, among other things, useful variable definitions for the compiled software, such as compiler and linker flags, dependencies and their versions, etc.</li>
<li>Autoconf - generate a configuration script from a TEMPLATE-FILE if given, or configure.ac if present, or else configure.in. Output is sent to the standard output if TEM‐PLATE-FILE is given, else into configure.
</details></li>
</ul>

<summary><b>./configure shows an error that libfoobar is missing on your system, how could you fix this, what could be wrong?</b></summary><br></p>

<p>Configure could not find libfoobar in <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> or libfoobar is not installed on your system. You can fix it by installing libfoobar package with package manager or build it from source. If libfoobar is already installed just check <code>/etc/ld.so.conf</code> and add right path to libfoobar

<summary><b>What are the advantages/disadvantages of script vs compiled program?</b></summary><br></p>

<p>Script program have the advantages of:</p>

<ul>
<li>flexibility to change the script</li>
<li>easier to implement (writing good compilers is very hard!!)</li>
<li>no need to run a compilation stage: can execute code directly &ldquo;on the fly&rdquo;</li>
<li>being more portable.</li>
</ul>

<p>Script program have the disadvantages of:</p>

<ul>
<li>much slow than compiled program</li>
<li>source code is open</li>
</ul>

<p>Compiled program have the advantages of:</p>

<ul>
<li>faster performance by directly using the native code of the target machine</li>
<li>opportunity to apply quite powerful optimisations during the compile stage</li>
<li>hides the source code from the end user</li>
</ul>

<p>Compiled program have the disadvantages of:</p>

<ul>
<li>slow to develop (edit, compile, link and run. The compile/link steps could take serious time).</li>
<li>to execute you need to compile a different executable for each type of processor and/or platform that you want your program to run on
</details></li>

<summary><b>What&rsquo;s the relationship between continuous delivery and DevOps?</b></summary><br></p>

<p>Continuous delivery(CD) is an agile way of working whereby quality products—normally software assets—can be developed, built, tested, and shipped in quick succession.
DevOps is another way of working whereby developers and system operators work in harmony with little or no organizational barriers between them towards a common goal.
</details></p>

<p><details>
<summary><b>What are the important aspects of a system of continuous integration and deployment?</b></summary><br></p>

<p>Automation\testing are the important aspects of a great development workflow. Every task that can be done by a machine should be. Automation gives you the time to focus. Through testing, you can be sure that the most important steps your customers will take through your system are working, regardless of the changes you make. This gives you the confidence to experiment, implement new features, and ship updates quickly.
